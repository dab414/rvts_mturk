# rVTS for mturk

In this project, I am preparing for mturk a paradigm that was recently developed in our laboratory. For more details about the research, see [this repository](https://github.com/dab414/braun_arrington_2018).  

A live version of this experiment is hosted at [this link](https://davebraun.org/rvts)  

The main source code for the experiment can be found through the links below:  

* [Phase 1](cued/index.html): A first-phase of the experiment where participants perform a task called cued task switching.  
* [Phase 2](run/index.html): The second phase, where participants perform task switching in a rewarded context. This is the novel phase.  
* [JavaScript Functions](js/rvts_functions.js): A collection of JavaScript functions coded specficially for this experiment.
