ideas for what's essentially the extended trial sequence of the experiment
im thinking about using a different html to handle the instructions and practice..
	it make things more organized.. not sure if it'll have any negative consequences

first screen
	i think the video tutorial should be the primary way we push ppl to learn
		make it clear how long the video is
	maybe have "welcome" text and basic navigation instructions next to the video
	navigation options:
		go to practice
		go to text instructions
		see basic information about the HIT (the stuff they should be able to see from mturk)

more instructions
	pretty much a transcript of the video
	option to go back to main screen

more information about HIT
	just listing out the stuff they should be able to see from mturk
	option to go back to main screen

practice
	short practice (16 trials?)
	kicks to screen displaying accuracy and whether or not it's above threshold
	do you want to keep practicing?
		restart practice
	are you ready to start main experiment?
		go to final instructions (link to separate html)

begin task
	starting here i can pretty much grab the structure that I already have

**issues**
dealing with counterbalancing
	need to be able to transfer key assignments from practice to real thing

	solution: pass through url
	anything after '#' gets disregarded, but can be retroactively grabbed

	from sender:
		window.location.href = '<path to profile.html>' + '#' + key_code

	from receiver:
		var key_code = window.location.hash.substring(1)
