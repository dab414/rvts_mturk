in this experiment, you'll be seeing one of these four simple colored shapes appearing on the screen, one after another
	all four shapes appearing in middle of white background

your job is to make simple judgments about these colored shapes, one after another
	one prototype shape remains on screen

you can either judge the color, by pressing a key for blue or red; or shape.. same
	show pics of keys tied to responses

once you make a response, the colored shape will change and you'll make the judgment again
	show changing stimulus

quick caveat that keys are different for everyone
	labels swap back and forth

the overall goal of the experiment is to earn a certain amount of points as quickly as possible
	maybe highlight point counter

there will be two numbers presented to either side of the object to show how many points you'll get for making a response with either hand
	for example.. but remember keys will be different for everyone

on the next trial, the points for the task you just performed will either go down by a point or remain the same
	opposite for other task
	it's like flipping coin to decide what'll happen for each task
	maybe animate coin..

if you make a mistake..
	show error 
	you want to have a good accuracy to get hit accepted

you'll first do a short number of practice trials, followed by real thing

press the button to the right to show your controls, and then begin the short practice
